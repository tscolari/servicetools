# SERVICETOOLS

This is a highly opinionated, experimental, proof of concept
library to help build services/microservices in Go.

This is very unstable as it's constantly being experimented
during interactions of other projects.

Documentation and tests will come as soon as I can decide on
what this should look like, and if it matures to that point.
